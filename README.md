## Running the app

### Docker

The easiest way is by using Docker. Just run this:

```
make docker-run
```

### Manually

To run it in your local env, you have to:

- Install Node 16 (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then run these commands in order,

- `npm install` (Install dependencies)
- `npm run start` (Starts the app in the dev server)
